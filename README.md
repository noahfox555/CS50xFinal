# CS50xFinal
Final project for CS50x offered by Harvard. This project was created in December 2020. This program is a website, similar to baseballreference.com, where a user can search for any baseball player from the beginning of baseball through 2019. The SQL database used in this program is property of Sean Lahman.

This project uses Flask to run the web application. SQL queries are made from Python, based on the user's search, to retrieve information from the database. Afterwards, an HTML template is rendered and presented to the user with the information about the player(s).
